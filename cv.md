## Code Samples
- __[English For Kids](https://kater328-english-for-kids.netlify.app/src/)__ - App for kids with adaptive design to learn English.  
The application works in two modes.  
The first mode is a practice mode for learning English words. By choosing a category, you can find out the translation of a word and hear its pronunciation. The second mode is a game mode where the player needs to find a word by pronunciation. Switching between modes occurs when you click on the Train / Play switch.  
Also, a page with statistics has been implemented, which calculates and stores user data for all time.
